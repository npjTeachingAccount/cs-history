                    Linus Torvalds delevloped the Linux Operating System which is widely used on the Internet to power
                    webservers,
                    database servers, and other application servers. Linux is also used in many embedded Oporating
                    Systems for Internet of Things type devices.
                    He is currently the primary "maintainer" of the code and leads the team of developers who work on
                    Linux. A new version of the OS is only released at his discretion.

                <h3 class="display-6">Biography</h3>
                <p>Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland, the 28th December 1969, the son of journalists Anna and Nils
                    Torvalds,[6] the grandson of statistician Leo Törnqvist and of poet Ole Torvalds, and the
                    great-grandson of journalist and soldier Toivo Karanko. His parents were campus radicals at the
                    University of Helsinki in the 1960s. His family belongs to the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland.
                    He was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize–winning American chemist, although in the book
                    Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution, he is quoted as saying, "I think I was named
                    equally for Linus the Peanuts cartoon character", noting that this made him "half Nobel
                    Prize–winning chemist and half blanket-carrying cartoon character".
