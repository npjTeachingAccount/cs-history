                <h3 class="display-6">Significance</h3>
                <p class="lead">Water clocks were one of the first methods of telling time. The amount of water lost or gained, depending on the function, could show how much time has passed in hours. Later advancements allowed water clocks to be accommodated for shorter days, present the hour of the day, and include gears and water wheels.
                The programmable water clocks can function similarly to analog computers.</p>
                <h3 class="display-6">History</h3>
                <p>The earliest recorded evidence of a water clock was found in Egypt dating back to somewhere around 1500 BC. It was invented by the Egyptian official Amenemhet. Water clocks would be found in Greece, Rome, and nearly all of Asia. Water clocks would be used in Asia as astronomical clocks starting in the 6th century BC. Water clocks would begin to implement gears in their functionality around the year 1000. The engineer Al-Jazari would describe a water clock that could be modified to accommodate for the different lengths of days called the elephant clock(shown) in 1206. Water clocks would eventually be replaced by pendulum clocks in the 17th century, although a small amount of water clocks remained in use until 1965.
