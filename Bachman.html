                <p> Charles William Bachman III (born December 11, 1924, Manhattan, Kansas, U.S.–died July 13, 2017, Lexington, 
				Massachusetts) was an American computer scientist and World War II veteran. Bachman was born with a dad working 
				as a football coach at Kansas Agriculture College in Manhattan. The family would move to wherever Bachman’s dad 
				would coach at. From Kansas to the University of Florida in Gainseville, then Michigan State University in East 
				Lansing. Bachman finished high school early and started Michigan State University. After a year, he joined the 
				United States Army in 1944 to fight in World War II then finished his bachelor’s degree in mechanical 
				engineering in 1948 at Michigan State. He also earned a master’s degree in mechanical engineering in 1950. 
				After graduation, he worked as an operations researcher for Dow Chemical Company in Midland, Michigan. There, he 
				would be selected to head a data-processing division of the company where years later would lead to the invention 
				of one of the world’s first database management software systems. He would retire in 1996 in Tucson, Arizona.
