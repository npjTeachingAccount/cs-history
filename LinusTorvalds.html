                <p> Linus Torvalds (born December 28, 1969, Helsinki, Finland) is a Finnish computer scientist who was the principal force behind the development of the Linux operating system. At the young age of 10 Torvalds began to find an interest in computer programming, and in 1991 he purchased his first personal computer while studying computer science at University of Helsinki. He was not satisfied with the operating system on his PS, as he preferred the UNIX systems found on the university's computers. He therefore decided to create his own PC-based version of UNIX, which meant the beginning of Linux.
